=head1 NAME

Hash::Match - match contents of a hash against rules

=begin readme

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

This module requires Perl v5.10 or newer, and the following non-core
modules:

=over

=item L<List::MoreUtils>

=item L<namespace::autoclean>

=end readme

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Hash::Match;

  my $m = Hash::Match->new( rules => { key => qr/ba/ } );

  $m->( { key => 'foo' } ); # returns false

  $m->( { key => 'bar' } ); # returns true

  $m->( { foo => 'bar' } ); # returns false

=head1 DESCRIPTION

TODO

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<new>

  my $m = Hash::Match->new( rules => $rules );

Returns a function that matches a hash reference against the
C<$rules>, e.g.

  if ( $m->( \%hash ) ) { ... }

=head3 Rules

The rules can be a hash or array reference of key-value pairs, e.g.

  {
    k_1 => 'string',    # k_1 eq 'string'
    k_2 => qr/xyz/,     # k_2 =~ qr/xyz/
    k_3 => sub { ... }, # k_3 exists and sub->($hash) is true
  }

For a hash reference, all keys in the rule must exist in the hash and
match the criteria specified by the rules' values.

For an array reference, at least one key must exist and match the
criteria specified in the rules.

The following special keys allow you to use nested boolean operators:

=over

=item C<-not>

  {
    -not => $subrules,
  }

Negate the C<$subrules>.

=item C<-and>

  [
    -and => \%subrules,
  ]

True if all of the C<%subrules> are true.

=item C<-or>

  {
    -or => \@subrules,
  }

True if at least one of the C<@subrules> is true.
